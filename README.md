# GameHub By Dinujaya

GameHub By Dinujaya is a web application built using React 18 with TypeScript. It allows users to search and browse video games using data from the RAWG Video Games Database API ([https://rawg.io/apidocs](https://rawg.io/apidocs)). Users can also filter games by genres and platforms, and view detailed information about a particular game, including its description, available platforms, and recommendations. The application has a responsive design optimized for viewing on different devices.

## How I Learned a Lot While Creating This Project

I completed Mosh Hamedani's React 18 with TypeScript course, which provided me with a solid foundation in building React applications using TypeScript. I learned how to use TypeScript with React to add static typing and improve the robustness of my code. I also learned how to fetch data from an external API, handle state and props in React components, and use popular UI libraries like Chakra UI for building the user interface.

During the development of this project, I gained hands-on experience in working with real-world data from the RAWG Video Games Database API and integrating it into my application. I learned how to create reusable components, manage state and props, handle user input, and implement responsive design for different devices. I also learned how to add animations to my application using Framer Motion and how to use popular libraries like Axios for making HTTP requests.

Overall, this project has been a great learning experience for me, allowing me to apply the concepts I learned in the course and gain practical experience in building a real-world React application with TypeScript.
